A Persona 5 themed wallpaper using the crowd sprites shown in the game's transition screens

## About

This is something I made as a result of not finding a wallpaper that I like for a few days. Although I do find some that can be considered, I'm still not satisfied.

I wanted a wallpaper that:

-   is dark themed (or the colors are mostly dark)
-   does not have a lot of details (like it only focuses on one thing or person)
-   comes from a franchise I like, I guess

After some more searching, I found this [wallpaper from Wallpaper Engine Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1255218296) that fits my bill, but I still feel like something is lacking. Since I don't need a dynamic wallpaper, that's when I've decided to create my own wallpaper.

I'm pretty sure the perspective doesn't look realistic, but I feel satisfied by the results.

You can download the wallpapers at the [Releases](https://github.com/ARipeAppleByYoursTruly/p5-crowd-wallpaper/releases) section of this repo.

I've also included psd files for your own modifications, maybe add your favorite character in the center, that's what I did.
